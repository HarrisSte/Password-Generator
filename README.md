# Password Generator

# Description
This project is intended to create a password generator that allows the user to select specific parameters to their desired password outcome. Upon clicking the 'generate password' button, users are then prompted for the following criteria: password legnth, lower case characters, upper case characters, numerical characters, and special chatacters. Once the desired characteristics are chosen, the outcome will then be logged and displayed on the webpage.

If the user does not select numbers between 8 and 128, they will be presented an error message. The user will also be prompted if they do not select the at least one character parameter.
