# Password Generator

# Description
This project is a password generator that allows users to select specific parameters for their desired password outcome. Upon clicking the 'generate password' button, users are prompted to indicate which criteria they want for their password: password length, lower case characters, upper case characters, numerical characters, and special characters. Once the desired characteristics are selected, the result is logged and displayed on the webpage.

If the user does not select numbers between 8 and 128, or at least one character, they will be presented with an error message and returned to the initial page where they began.

For this project, I utilized multiple resources to aid in the outcome of this project. I acquired help from my tutor, Ben Martin, via a one-on-one session. The resources provided by my instructor in the boot camp aided in supplementing my process of developing this project. I referenced outside sources, such as websites and tutorial videos, through W3Schools, MDN, and StackOverflow. I also conferred with a colleague, Andrew ZÃ¼mwalt, when I ran in to an obstacle.
